I included the Apache 2 license as it is the one used by neovim and I was unsure whether it would be needed in this case.

Some of the contents of these configuration files consist of bits and pieces of examples written by people online, it is not a solely original work.

I provide no warranty of any kind what so ever. As tweaking my neovim configuration is an ongoing process, I can in fact guarantee that some parts of it will not work.
